    メインピッチのディスクリプションKaldi is the coffee store for everyone who believes that
    great coffee shouldn't just taste good, it should do good too. We source all
    of our beans directly from small scale sustainable farmers and make sure
    part of the profits are reinvested in their communities.

  about their java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
  production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
  knowledge to anyone.

        その４We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
